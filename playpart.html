<b>KNUT BROVIK.</b><br>

[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
much longer!</p>

<b>KAIA.</b><br>

[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
Uncle?


<b>BROVIK.</b><br>

<p>Oh, I seem to get worse every day.</p>


<b>RAGNAR.</b><br>

<p>[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
little sleep--</p>


<b>BROVIK.</b><br>

<p>[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>


<b>KAIA.</b><br>

<p>Then take a little walk.</p>


<b>RAGNAR.</b><br>

<p>Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>


<b>BROVIK.</b><br>

<p>[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
him--with the chief.</p>


<b>KAIA.</b><br>

<p>[Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!</p>


<b>RAGNAR.</b><br>

<p>Yes, better wait, father!</p>


<b>BROVIK.</b><br>

<p>[Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
waiting.</p>


<b>bKAIA.</b><br>

<p>[Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.

     [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.


  HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
  longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
  hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
  greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
  broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
  and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.</p>


<b>SOLNESS.</b><br>

<p>[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
whisper:] Are they gone?</p>


<b>KAIA.</b><br>

<p>[Softly, shaking her] No.

     [She takes the shade off her eyes.  SOLNESS crosses the room,
       throws his hat on a chair, places the portfolios on the table
       by the sofa, and approaches the desk again.  KAIA goes on
       writing without intermission, but seems nervous and uneasy.</p>


<b>SOLNESS.</b><br>

<p>[Aloud.] What is that you are entering, Miss Fosli?</p>


<b>KAIA.</b><br>

<p>[Starts.] Oh, it is only something that--</p>


<b>SOLNESS.</b><br>

<p>Let me look at it, Miss Fosli. [Bends over her, pretends to be looking
into the ledger, and whispers:] Kaia!</p>
